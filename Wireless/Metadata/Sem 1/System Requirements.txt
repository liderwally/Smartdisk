System Requirements for Wireless USB Flash Drive Project
Here are some key system requirements to consider for your wireless USB flash drive project:

Hardware:

Flash Storage:
Capacity: Determine the desired storage capacity based on your target users and their needs. Consider offering different options.
Type: Decide between standard flash memory or more durable options like SSDs for increased performance and reliability.
Interface: USB 2.0 is still widely compatible, but USB 3.0 or 3.1 Gen 1 will offer faster transfer speeds.
Wireless Module:
Protocol: Choose Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or both based on desired range, power consumption, and supported devices.
Range: Consider the intended use case and how far users need to access the drive wirelessly.
Security: Implement encryption and authentication protocols to protect data during wireless transfers.
Microcontroller:
Processing Power: Select a microcontroller that can handle data transfer, wireless communication, and USB interface efficiently.
Power Consumption: Choose a low-power option to maximize battery life or optimize for performance if plugged in.
Battery (Optional):
Capacity: Estimate battery life based on expected usage and wireless activity.
Charging: Decide on a charging method like micro-USB or USB-C.
Enclosure:
Size and Weight: Design a compact and lightweight enclosure for portability.
Durability: Choose materials that can withstand everyday use and protect the internal components.
Software:

Operating System: Select a lightweight OS like FreeRTOS or Zephyr RTOS for embedded devices.
File System: Choose a file system compatible with various devices and platforms (e.g., FAT32, exFAT).
Wireless Stack: Implement communication protocols for chosen wireless technology (e.g., Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth Low Energy).
USB Mass Storage Class (MSC): Implement this protocol to enable standard USB drive access when connected directly.
Security Features: Integrate encryption and authentication algorithms to protect data.
Mobile App (Optional): Develop or integrate with an existing app for managing files, transfers, and settings.
Additional Considerations:

Power Management: Optimize power consumption for longer battery life and minimize heat generation.
Regulatory Compliance: Ensure adherence to relevant wireless and safety regulations.
User Interface: Design a simple and intuitive interface for both wireless and USB access.
Troubleshooting and Diagnostics: Implement features for diagnostics and troubleshooting any connection or technical issues.
Cost: Balance desired features with budget constraints when selecting components.
Testing and Prototyping:

Start with a basic prototype to test core functionalities and wireless connectivity.
Gradually add features and refine the design based on testing and feedback.
Conduct thorough testing for compatibility, performance, security, and battery life.
Remember, these are general guidelines, and you may need to adjust them based on your specific project goals and target audience.
